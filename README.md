# Afoodable 

A shopping list & recipe helper.

## Tech (MEAN stack)
* **Client:** Angular 14.2.3, Material, ToastR, RxJS, CdkDrag
* **Server:** Node, Express, MongoDb, Multer, 
* **DB:** MongoDB (Atlas) 

## The Why?
We don't enjoy the monotony of hand writing recipes and curating shopping lists. 
We also didn't want to use a paywalled app in order to improve this aspect of day-to-day life.
This was created to suit our needs and what we would want from a shopping list/recipe app.

## About
Search and select recipes that you want. This then adds those components to the shopping list:
![Recipe Select](recipes-page.gif?raw=true "Recipe Select")

View recipes and steps to cook. Edit the recipes or ingredients.
![Other pages](other-pages.gif?raw=true "Other pages")
